# The Invisible Project
Screecat Co. has come up with a new invention... the invisible project. In this project, is just a readme. There's no code. Muahahahahahah

Here's another evil fact about Screecat Co.: We have a website, but the source code is closed source, so its not on this github. Muahahahahahah
Whoops, dropped a website: https://screecat-co.vercel.app/
